AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting motor 
      neurons and other neuronal cells, leading to severe disability and eventually death 
      from ventilatory failure. It has a prevalence of 5 in 100,000, with an incidence of 
      1.7 per 100,000, reflecting short average survival. The pathogenesis is incompletely 
      understood, but defects of RNA processing and protein clearance may be fundamental. 
      Repeat expansions in the chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 gene (C9orf72) are the 
      most common known genetic cause of ALS and are seen in approximately 40% of patients 
      with a family history and approximately 10% of those without. No environmental risk 
      factors are proved to be causative, but many have been proposed, including military 
      service. The diagnosis of ALS rests on a history of painless progressive weakness 
      coupled with examination findings of upper and lower motor dysfunction. No 
      diagnostic test is yet available, but electromyography and genetic tests can support 
      the diagnosis. Care for patients is best provided by a multidisciplinary team, and 
      most interventions are directed at managing symptoms. Two medications with modest 
      benefits have Food and Drug Administration approval for the treatment of ALS: 
      riluzole, a glutamate receptor antagonist, and, new in 2017, edaravone, a free 
      radical scavenger. Many other encouraging treatment strategies are being explored in 
      clinical trials for ALS; herein we review stem cell and antisense oligonucleotide 
      gene therapies.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal progressive neurodegenerative disease 
      characterized by a permanent degeneration of both upper and lower motor neurons. 
      Many different genes and pathophysiological processes contribute to this disease, 
      however its exact cause remains unclear. Therefore, it is necessary to understand 
      this heterogeneity to find effective treatments. In this review, we focus on 
      selected environmental and genetic risk factors predisposing to ALS and highlight 
      emerging treatments in ALS therapy. Of numerous defective genes associated with ALS, 
      we focus on four principal genes that have been identified as definite causes of 
      ALS: the SOD1 gene, C9orf72, TDP-43, as well as the recently identified TBK1. We 
      also provide up-to-date information on selected environmental factors that have 
      historically been considered as key players in ALS development and pathogenesis. In 
      parallel to our survey of known risk factors, we also discuss emerging ALS stem cell 
      therapies and experimental medicines currently undergoing phase II and III clinical 
      trials.
